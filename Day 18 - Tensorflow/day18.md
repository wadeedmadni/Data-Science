### Machine Learning
Machine Learning makes the rules for us. ðŸ‘‡

**GOAL:** Acieve highest accuracy possible

### Neural Networks
Layered represntation of Data

> **What are features and labels?** \
> Labels are also called output information

> `Training Data has Features and Labels both.` \
> `Testing Data only has Features as it predicts Labels.`

### Supervised Learning
* Most common type of learning

**Features -> Labels** \
Example: predicitng final exam marks of student based on module 1 and module 2

### Unupervised Learning

**Features Only** \
Example: clustering

### Reinforcement Learning
* Environment
* Agent
* Reward

## How it works?
2 Main components
1. Graphs
    * It creates graph of partial computations. 
    * When we write code, we create  graphs. 
    * When we create variable it writes down, variable 3 is sum of variable 1 and variable 2. it does not store the values but computations. 
    > As different computations are linked to each other , that's why it is called graph.
2. Sessions
    * A way of executing part or entire graph
    * When we start a session, we start executing parts of graphs 


## What are Tensors?
A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higer dimensions.
* Vector can have nay dimension in it
 * If it has x1 then it has 1 dimensions
 * if it has x1, y1 then ith as 2 dimension
