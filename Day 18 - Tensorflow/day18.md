### Machine Learning
Machine Learning makes the rules for us. ðŸ‘‡

**GOAL:** Acieve highest accuracy possible

### Neural Networks
Layered represntation of Data

> **What are features and labels?** \
> Labels are also called output information

> `Training Data has Features and Labels both.` \
> `Testing Data only has Features as it predicts Labels.`

### Supervised Learning
* Most common type of learning

**Features -> Labels** \
Example: predicitng final exam marks of student based on module 1 and module 2

### Unupervised Learning

**Features Only** \
Example: clustering

### Reinforcement Learning
* Environment
* Agent
* Reward

## How it works?
2 Main components
1. Graphs
    * It creates graph of partial computations. 
    * When we write code, we create  graphs. 
    * When we create variable it writes down, variable 3 is sum of variable 1 and variable 2. it does not store the values but computations. 
    > As different computations are linked to each other , that's why it is called graph.
2. Sessions
    * A way of executing part or entire graph
    * When we start a session, we start executing parts of graphs 


## What are Tensors?
A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higer dimensions.
* Vector can have nay dimension in it
 * If it has x1 then it has 1 dimensions
 * if it has x1, y1 then ith as 2 dimension

### Data Types in Tensors
* float32 _(most common)_ , int32, string and others 

**Shape:** It represents the dimensions

### How to make a Tensor?

```python
string = tf.Variable("This is a String", tf.string)
number = tf.Variable(324, tf.int64)
floating = tf.Variable(4.247, tf.float64)
```
### Rank/Degree of Tensors
 It menas the number of dimension involved in the tensor. 

The above created [tensors](#how-to-make-a-tensor) are or Rank 0, also known as a Scalar

#### Higher Rank/Dimension Tensors
```python
rank1_tensor = tf.Variable(["Test", "One Dimension"], tf.String)
rank2_tensor = tf.Variable([["Test", "Two"], ["Test2", "dimension"]], tf.String)
```

> **Dimensions can be determined by deepest level of nested list**

#### To check the dimension of a tensor:
```python
tf.rank(rank2_tensor)
```

#### To check the shape of a tensor:
```python
rank2_tensor.shape
```
> `TensorShape([2, 2])`

First 2 represents the number of lists it has Second 2 represnts number of elements in each list

Similarly, 
```python
rank3_tensor = tf.Variable([["Test", "Two", "additonal"], ["Test2", "dimension", "additonal"], ["additonal", "additonal", "additonal"]], tf.String)

rank3_tensor.shape
```
> `TensorShape([3, 3])`

`rank3_tensor` has 3 lists and each list has 3 elements

### Changing Shapes

```python
tensor1 = tf.ones([1,2,3])  # tf.ones() creates a shape [1,2,3] tensor full of ones
tensor2 = tf.reshape(tensor1, [2,3,1])  # reshape existing data to shape [2,3,1]
tensor3 = tf.reshape(tensor2, [3, -1])  # -1 tells the tensor to calculate the size of the dimension in that place
                                        # this will reshape the tensor to [3,3]
                                                                             
# The numer of elements in the reshaped tensor MUST match the number in the original
```
