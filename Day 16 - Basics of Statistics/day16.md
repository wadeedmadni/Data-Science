### **Statistics for Data Science**
1. **Tests and their Types**
    * |Parametric Tests|Non-Parametric Tests|
        |---|---|
        |More reliable results|Less reliable|
    * **Normality Test** \
        First step to always check the normality of Data. \
            a. Tests to be used \
            1. Shapiro-Wilk Test (reliable) \
            2. Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (less reliable) \
        ![Bell Curve](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/normal-distribution-1.svg)

    * **Homogeneity Test** \
        The variance of the variable in the data are equal \
            a. Tests to be used \
            1. Levene's Test \

    * **Purpose** \
        Know the purpose of your _Research Question_.

        * **Types of Purposes** 
            1. **Comparison:** Difference  (5 people like pizza, 3 does not)
                * Between atleast 2 groups (Male vs Female, Control Group vs Treatments Group)
            2. **Relationship:** Connection (3rd and 6 person like pizza, what's common)
                * Finding a connection (Can a food predict weight of a group of individuals, Does fertilizer application increases crop growth)
                * We seek Connection, Correlation, Causation, Prediction
    * **Data Type**
        * **Categorical:** Qualitative Data (yes/no)
        * **Continous:** Qualitative Data (price)
        * Example: You went to a resturant to have lunch, you like pizza, burger and sandwich (categorical data) and thier prices are $21, $16, $8 (continous data)

    * **Statistical Tests**
        * 3 families of Statistical test 
            |Chi-Squared|t-Test/ANOVA|Correlation|
            |:---:|:---:|:---:|
            |Purpose: Comparison|Comparison|Relationship|
            |Categorical Only|Categorical & Continous|Continous|
