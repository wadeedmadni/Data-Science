## **Types of Machine Learning**

1. Supervised ML
    * Works under supervision
    * Prediction
    * Output
        * **Types**
            * Classification: For Categories (non-numeric data)
            * Regression: Numerical Data

2. Unsupervised ML (clustering)
    * No supervision
    * No labeliing of data
    * Find Patterns by itself

3. Semi-Supervised ML
    * Mixture of 1 & 2
    * Some Data is labelled, most is not

4. Reinforcemnet ML
    * Hit and trial learning
    * Learn from mistakes
    * Reward and punishment rule
    * Prediction based on reward and punishment rule
    * Depends on feedback

## **How Scikit-learn works?**
There are two variables in this: 
1. Dependent Variable **( y )**
2. Independent Variable **( x )**

**_y depends upon x_**

#### Simple Limear Regression
1. Relationship between 2 variables
2. New prediction is made on the basis of relationship
3. Equation: y = a + bx  (a = constant/intercept b= function/slope of x)
